### ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm @Mxnrxjj

I'm a developer passionate about building high-performance, low-latency systems in **C++** while also leveraging **Python** for data analysis and **React.js** for crafting intuitive user interfaces. My work focuses on applying advanced data structures and algorithms to solve complex, real-world problems.

### ðŸš€ My Core Project

My main project is a **High-Performance Order Matching Engine**, a server that simulates the core functionality of a real stock exchange. It's built from scratch in C++ and engineered for both speed and robustness.

* **Engineered with DSA:** The system uses a min-max heap (priority queue) for `O(1)` best-price access and a lazy deletion strategy with an unordered map for efficient order cancellations.
* **Performance-Driven:** It's capable of processing over **2 million orders per second** on a single thread.
* **Next Steps:** I am currently implementing a **deterministic latency profiling framework**. This involves using **Python** with libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib to analyze and visualize the performance data captured from the C++ core.
